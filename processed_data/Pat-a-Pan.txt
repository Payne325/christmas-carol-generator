Willie, take your little drum,
Robin, bring your fife, and come,
And be merry while you play.
Turelurelu. Patapatapan.
Come be merry while you play,
On this joyous Christmas day.
Guillô, pran tun tamborin,
Toi, pran tu fleute, Robin.
Au son de cés instruman.
God and man became today,
More in tune than fife and drum,
So be merry while you play.
