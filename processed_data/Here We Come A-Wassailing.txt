Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green;
Here we come a-wandering, so fair to be seen.
Love and joy come to you, and to you our wassail, too.
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
We are not daily beggars that beg from door to door;
But we are neighbours' children whom you have seen before. 
We have a little purse made of ratching leather skin;
We want a little sixpence to line it well within. 
God bless the master of this house, likewise the mistress, too;
And all the little children that round the table go. Refrain
