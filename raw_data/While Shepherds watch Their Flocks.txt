While Shepherds watch their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone arond
"Fear not," said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all man-kind"

"To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
And this shall me the sign
The heav'n'ly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
And in a manger laid"

Thus spoke the seraph and forth-with
Appeared a shiny throng
Of angels praising God who thus
Addressed their joyful song
"All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace
Goodwill hence-forth from heav'n to men
Begin and never cease"
