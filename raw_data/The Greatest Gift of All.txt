Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Claus to come

There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children ev'rywhere

Through the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all

Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas ev'ryone
Is the song it sings

So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on earth goodwill to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on earth goodwill to men
Is the greatest gift of all
