Pine cones and Holly Berries
Popcorn for you, apples for me
Red striped candy, nut cracker handy
Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.
snow clouds hang low and threatening
Maybe in won't, praying it may
the brightest fireplace glows in every face
Waiting for Christmas day.

There'll be walk-a-round songs and
talk-a-round songs
Songs of the inn and stable.
There'll be morning time songs and
evening time songs
And grace at every table.
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.
