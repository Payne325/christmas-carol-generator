When Christ was born of Mary free,
In Bethlehem in that fair city,
Angels sung e'er with mirth and glee,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria,
In excelsis gloria.
 Herdsmen beheld these angels bright-
To them appeared with great light,
And said, "God's son is born this night." Refrain
 This King is come to save His kind,
In the Scripture as we find;
Therefore this song we have in mind: Refrain
 Then, dear Lord, for Thy great grace,
Grant us the bliss to see Thy face,
Where we may sing to Thy solace: Refrain
